# Next Generation Repeater Project (NGRPT)
Most repeaters are based on old equipment and are pretty stuck in 1970/80s technology. There is a place for a next generation repeater based on SDRs and open source software at its core. This would facilitate more experimentation at the infrastructure layer of our hobby.

Join us and contribute to the evolution of what we do as Amateur Radio Enthusiasts!
